```bash
LGTM  —  looks good to me
ACK  —  acknowledgement, i.e. agreed/accepted change
NACK/NAK — negative acknowledgement, i.e. disagree with change and/or concept
RFC  —  request for comments, i.e. I think this is a good idea, lets discuss
WIP  —  work in progress, do not merge yet
AFAIK/AFAICT  —  as far as I know / can tell
IIRC  —  if I recall correctly
IANAL  — “ I am not a lawyer ”, but I smell licensing issues
```
